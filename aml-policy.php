                                    ensure that Tech Sport Global and its staff are able to comply with all legal and regulatory
                                    requirements relevant to the prevention of money laundering and financial crime.

                                    to think about potential financial crime risks as they carry out their duties and to
                                    be fully aware of the firm’s internal procedures to deter the potential use of Tech Sport Global

                                    regulations in each jurisdiction in which it does business.</p>

                                    the requirements</h1>
                                <p>Globally, there has been a
                                    long-standing obligation to have effective procedures in place to detect and prevent
                                    money laundering. Specifically, Tech Sport Global is registered in St Vincents and the Grenadines
                                    and the Anti Money Laundering and Terrorist Financial regulations (2014) in St
                                    Vincents and the Grenadines place an obligation on the Firm to adopt suitable AML
                                    policies and procedures. Tech Sport Global is committed to following all global standards and
                                    applicable legislation and has implemented the policies and procedures referred to
                                    in the document to ensure we are able to detect and prevent money laundering taking
                                    place through the Firm.</p>
                                <h1>2.1 What is Money Laundering?</h1>
                                <p>Money laundering is the process by
                                    which criminals attempt to conceal the true origins and/or ownership of the
                                    proceeds, or benefits, of criminal activity. The aim of the process is to achieve a
                                    situation where the proceeds of their activities appear legitimate; enabling them to
                                    avoid prosecution, conviction and the confiscation of the criminal funds. Financial
                                    institutions are used for the purpose of money laundering and therefore employees
                                    within the sector must be aware of the regulatory requirements placed both upon the
                                    firm they work for and themselves as individuals.</p>
                                <h1>2.2 The Stages of Money Laundering
                                </h1>
                                <p>Money laundering is traditionally
                                    described as only having 3 basic stages but it is important to remember that these
                                    stages do not necessarily occur in every case. Also, the boundaries between them may
                                    be blurred or overlap. Money laundering takes many forms and the classic money
                                    laundering model does not always apply. For example, someone may handle the benefits
                                    of acquisitive crimes (such as theft, fraud or tax evasion) and still be caught by
                                    the money laundering definition. Nonetheless, the 3 classic stages of laundering are
                                    outlined briefly below:</p>
                                <p><b>Placement :</b> The physical
                                    introduction of cash or other proceeds into the financial system – for example, by
                                    depositing cash into a bank account.</p>
                                <p><b>Layering :</b> The process of moving
                                    the proceeds through a number of (sometimes complex) financial transactions, so as
                                    to make the audit trail more difficult to trace back.</p>
                                <p><b>Examples include:</b></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>selling one investment and reinvesting in another;</li>
                                    <li>moving the money between different institutions or jurisdictions; and</li>
                                    <li>setting up vehicles such as companies and trusts so as to change the apparent
                                        ownership of the assets.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>It is at the layering stage that
                                    Tech Sport Global is most exposed.</p>
                                <p><b>Integration:</b> This is the point at
                                    which the funds have been sufficiently distanced from their origin to have achieved
                                    the appearance of legitimacy and the money is integrated into the economy.</p>
                                <h1>2.3 Suspicious Activity</h1>
                                <h1>It is at the layering stage that
                                    Tech Sport Global is most at risk although employees should be vigilant for any suspicious

                                    about a client is an invaluable tool in the fight against financial crime and when

                                    will enable the firm to re-verify the client’s identity. These documents must be
                                    kept for five years following the date on which the client ceases to be a client or

                                    similarities between the movement terrorist property and the laundering of criminal
                                    property: some terrorist groups are known to have well-established links with
                                    organised criminal activity. However, there are two major differences between
                                    terrorist property and criminal property:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Often only small amounts are required to commit individual terrorist acts, thus
                                        increasing the difficulty of tracking the terrorist property;</li>
                                    <li>Terrorists can be funded from legitimately obtained income, including charitable
                                        donations, and it is extremely difficult to identify the stage at which
                                        legitimate funds become terrorist property.</li>

                                    however, require quite significant funding and property to resource their
                                    infrastructure. They often control property and funds from a variety of sources and
                                    employ modern techniques to manage these funds, and to move them between
                                    jurisdictions.</p>
                                <p>In combating terrorist financing,

                                    for suspecting that such property could be used to finance terrorist activity.</p>

                                <li>1.A client opens an account and
                                    immediately gives an order to conduct a significant transaction in a particular
                                    security, especially if the client is insistent that the order is carried out very
                                    urgently.</li>
                                <li>2.A transaction is significantly
                                    out of line with the client’s previous investment behavior e.g. type of security,
                                    amount invested, size of order</li>
                                <li>3.There is unusual trading in the
                                    shares of a company before the announcement of price sensitive information relating
                                    to the company</li>
                                <li>4.An employee’s own account
                                    transaction is timed just before clients’ transactions and related orders in the
                                    same financial instrument</li>
                                <li>5.An order will, because of its
                                    size in relation to the market in that security, clearly have a significant impact
                                    on the supply or demand for or the price or value of the security
                                This list is not exhaustive; it just provides some examples of what constitutes suspicious activity.</li>
